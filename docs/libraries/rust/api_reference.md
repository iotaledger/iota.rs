API reference

You can read the [API reference](https://docs.rs/iota-core) here, or generate it yourself.

If you'd like to explore the implementation in more depth, the following command generates docs for the whole crate, including private modules:

```bash
cargo doc --document-private-items --no-deps --open
```
