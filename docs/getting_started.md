# Getting Started

To check out our examples and write and test your own code, you would need an IDE or a code editor of your choice and a stable internet connection. You also need to set up your environment. Continue with our instructions for [Rust](./libraries/rust/getting_started.md), [Node.js](./libraries/nodejs/getting_started.md), or [Python](./libraries/python/getting_started.md).

We assume that you already know the basics of the programming language of your choice. Companies and communities behind each language provide their own documentation for beginners: [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started), [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/), [Python](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/). You could start with that first, or refer to these guides as you read through our iota.rs documentation. If you have never programmed in your life, MIT has published an open [introductory course to programming](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/intro-programming/#general). Check it out!
