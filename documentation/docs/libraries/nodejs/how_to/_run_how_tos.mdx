## Prerequisites

Before you can run the examples, please refer to the [Node.js Getting Started guide](./../../../getting_started/nodejs.mdx) to install
the library.

## Build the Examples

### Set Up Your `.env` File

The examples use variables from a `.env` file. Though you can create your own, for the examples you can simply copy the
existing [`.env.example`](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs/blob/develop/bindings/nodejs/.env.example) file. You can
do this running the following command from the `bindings/nodejs` directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Build All the Examples

Since the [examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs/tree/develop/bindings/nodejs/examples) are written in
TypeScript, they first need to be compiled to JavaScript, before you can run them. To do this run the following commands
in the [examples folder](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs/tree/develop/bindings/nodejs/examples) :

```bash
npm i
npm run build
```

After you have run this command, you should have a newly create `dist` folder within the `examples` folder with all the
compiled examples.

### Build a Single Example

You can also use `tsc exampleName.js` from the `examples` folder to compile a specific example.

## Run the Examples

To run any Node.js example, you need to select any of the
[Node.js examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs/tree/dev/bindings/nodejs/examples) and run it with your local
Node.js interpreter. The following snippet runs `00_get_info.js` from the project root:

```bash
node client/bindings/nodejs/examples/dist/00_get_info.js
```
