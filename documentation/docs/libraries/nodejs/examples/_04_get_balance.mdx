There are three common API calls you can use to get a balance:

## [`Client.getAddressBalance(address: string)`](./../api_reference.md#getaddressbalanceaddress-promise)

It expects a single address in Bech32 format and returns `dict` with a balance for the address.

## [`Client.getAddressBalances(AddressBalance[]: string[])`](./../api_reference.md#getaddressbalancesaddresses-promiseaddressbalance)

A convenient function that expects `list` of addresses in Bech32 format and returns list of `dict` with balances for all
given addresses.

## [`Client.getBalance(seed: string)`](./../api_reference.md#getbalanceseed-string-balancegetter)

A convenient helper [`BalanceGetter`](./../api_reference.md#balancegetter) class that combines
[`Client.getAddresses()`](./../api_reference.md#getaddressesseed-addressgetter) and
`Client.getAddressBalance()` api calls. It returns a combined balance for the provided `seed` and optional chaining
calls [`.accountIndex(index: number)`](./../api_reference.md#accountindexindex-balancegetter),
[`.initialAddressIndex(index: number)`](./../api_reference.md#initialaddressindexindex-balancegetter) and
[`.gapLimit(amount: number)`](./../api_reference.md#gaplimitamount-balancegetter).

`Client.getBalance(seed)` performs several tasks under the hood. It starts by generating addresses for the provided
`seed` and `.accountIndex` from `.initialAddressIndex(index)`, and checks for a balance of each of the generated
addresses. Since it does not know how many addresses are used in fact, there is a condition set by the
`.gapLimit(amount)` argument to know when to stop searching. If the `.gapLimit` amount of addresses in a row have no
balance, the function returns results and searching does not continue.

Example of output:

```json
{
   "address":"atoi1qp9427varyc05py79ajku89xarfgkj74tpel5egr9y7xu3wpfc4lkpx0l86",
   "balance":10000000,
   "dustAllowed":false
}
Account balance: 0
```

- `dustAllowed` indicates whether the given address is allowed to accept a dust. You can learn more about dust
  protection in the
  [Chrysalis documentation](https://wiki.iota.org/chrysalis-docs/faq#what-is-dust-protection-and-how-does-it-work).
