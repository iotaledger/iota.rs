You can generate an IOTA address using the [`AddressGetter`](../api_reference.md#addressgetter) helper
class and calling the [`Client.getAddresses()`](../api_reference.md#getaddressesseed-addressgetter)
function and respective chaining calls that will return a list of tuples with the generated addresses. You can find
more information on the parameters in the [Address/Key Space section](../../../explanations/address_key_space.md).

The whole process is deterministic. This means the output is the same as long as the seed is the same:

<CodeBlock className="language-javascript">
  {generate_addresses}
</CodeBlock>

**Output example**:

```string
[
  'atoi1qz6dr6dtl0856tf0pczz7gesrf7j8a4vr00q58ld2zx7ttlv3p96snpym9z',
  'atoi1qpp7sz28a0ghvd6knwnljr7j2s04qquduuc5vlz94fwf94zznj2yv5ew2c4',
  'atoi1qzje6zhg5vu456eg3z84ekcfn3laxqyczche5eeqhcdh3w9yr5sqvr4z4td',
  'atoi1qqwhxjmcvmatpedeedapgx0vwyupfwx9k5n4w0lnc5l6vmz78aavwhs55v0',
  'atoi1qzg63t9880jtfysvpq7rrynz0rqt3kd2fw8r4934ezraz9dpwvzxkw2dtmh'
]
```

IOTA addresses are represented by a checksumed base-32 string (Bech32). You can find a detailed explanation in the
[Chrysalis documentations](https://wiki.iota.org/chrysalis-docs/guides/developer/#iota-15-address-anatom), but here are
parts relevant to this example:

* If an address starts with `atoi` then it means it is related to `devnet`. `iota` stands for `mainnet`.
* Number `1` at the 5<sup>th</sup> positvion is just a separator.
* The last 6 characters are reserved for a checksum.

Addresses can be also represented in a hex format and `iota.rs` provides some convenient functions to convert addresses:
[`Client.bech32ToHex(bech32)`](../api_reference.md#bech32tohexbech32) and
[`Client.hexToBech32(hex, bech32_hrp (optional))`](../api_reference.md#hextobech32hex-bech32_hrp-optional).

If you want to quickly validate any IOTA address, you can use the
[`Client.isAddressValid()`](../api_reference.md#isaddressvalidaddress-string-boolean) function that
returns a `bool` value. You should perform a sanity check on address before using it.
