## Prerequisites

Before you can run the examples, please refer to the [Python Getting Started guide](./../../../getting_started/python.mdx) to install
the library.

## Run Code Examples

The iota.rs library has numerous [examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs/tree/develop/client/bindings/python/examples)
you can run to get acquainted with the library. After you have followed the instructions to
[install the library](./../../../getting_started/python.mdx#install-the-library), you can run any example with the following
command from the `bindings/python` directory:

```bash
python3 example/[example file name]
```

Where [example file name] is one of the
[examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs/tree/develop/bindings/python/examples).

For instance, to run
[`00_get_info.py` ](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs/blob/develop/bindings/python/examples/00_get_info.py),
you should run:


```bash
python3 examples/00_get_info.py
```
