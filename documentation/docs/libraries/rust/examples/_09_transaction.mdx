Sending value-based messages is a very straightforward process if you use the
[`ClientMessageBuilder`](https://docs.rs/iota-client/latest/iota_client/api/struct.ClientMessageBuilder.html) helper
class. You will only need to provide a valid seed by chaining a call to
[`.with_seed(seed: &'a Seed)`](https://docs.rs/iota-client/latest/iota_client/api/struct.ClientMessageBuilder.html#method.with_seed), and
output address and amount by chaining a call to
[`.with_output(address: &str, amount: u64)`](https://docs.rs/iota-client/latest/iota_client/api/struct.ClientMessageBuilder.html#method.with_output).
The method will find valid output(s) that can be used to fund the given amount(s) and the unspent amount will be sent to
the same address.
